<br>Fixed Quest 2 Hardware ID mismatch - Unsigned Driver 
<br>Usage: Shift + Reboot. Select advanced and 7) disable driver signing before install. Connect quest 2, in device manager right click ADB and XRSP device update driver, select android_winusb.inf. Then click allow install anyway.
<br>I test it on Windows 10. Seems like working. All i did was adding the Hardware ID of quest 2 to driver. Unfortunately this breaks driver signature.
